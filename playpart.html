    <h4>NORA.</h4>
     <p>Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed.</p>
     <p>[To the PORTER, taking out her purse.]</p>
     <p>How much?</p>

    <h4>PORTER.</h4>
      <p>Sixpence.</p>

    <h4>NORA.</h4>
      <p>There is a shilling. No, keep the change.</p>
      <p>[The PORTER thanks her, and goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husbandâ€™s door and listens.]</p>
      <p>Yes, he is in.</p>
      <p>[Still humming, she goes to the table on the right.]</p>

    <h4>HELMER.</h4>
       <p>[calls out from his room]</p>
       <p>Is that my little lark twittering out there?.</p>

    <h4>NORA.</h4>
       <p>[busy opening some of the parcels].</p>
       <p>Yes, it is!</p>

    <h4>HELMER.</h4>
       <p>Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>

    <h4>NORA.</h4>
       <p>Yes!</p>
